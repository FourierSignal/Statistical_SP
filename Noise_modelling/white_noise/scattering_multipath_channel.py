Wireless channel is of time-varying nature in which the parameters randomly change with respect to time. 
Wireless channel is very harsh when compared to AWGN channel model

Complex baseband mutipath channel model:
 
 In a multipath channel, multiple copies of a signal travel different paths with different propagation delays \tau 
 and are received at the receiver at different phase angles and strengths. 
 These rays add constructively or destructively at the receiver front end, thereby giving rise to rapid fluctuations in the channel. 
 
 
 The multipath channel can be viewed as a linear time variant system where the parameters change randomly with respect to time. The channel impulse response is a two dimensional random variable – h(t, \tau) that is a function of two parameters –  instantaneous time t and the propagation delay \tau.
 
 The  channel is expressed as a set of random complex gains at a given time t and the propagation delay \tau. The output of the channel y(t) can be expressed as the convolution of the complex channel impulse response h(t, \tau) and the input x(t)
